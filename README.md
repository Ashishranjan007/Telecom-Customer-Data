# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn trends and predicting potential churners using advanced data analytics and visualization tools. By leveraging Python and Power BI, actionable insights are derived to assist in decision-making processes.

## Files
- **Data/Customer_Data.xlsx**: Contains the dataset used for churn analysis and prediction.
- **code/sql queries.sql**: file to extract and manipulate data from a database.
- **codeChurn Analysis.pbix**: Power BI report visualizing customer churn trends and actionable insights.
- **code/python_data.ipynb**: Scripts or notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards in Power BI for better insights.
3. **Prediction Model:** Using regression and classification techniques to predict churn likelihood.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
2. Open the Power BI report (`reports/Churn Analysis.pbix`) for visualization.
3. Run scripts in the `src/` folder to preprocess data and train predictive models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel**: Dataset preparation.
- **SQL**: For data extraction and transformation.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python**: Libraries used include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
